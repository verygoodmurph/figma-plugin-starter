# Figma Plugin Starter Template

Demonstrates essential Figma plugin concepts:

- Custom UI integration
- Code and UI message passing
- Async operations with dynamic pages
- UI updates from plugin logic
- Light and dark mode support
- External font handling
- User notifications
- Console logging

## Quick Start Method

1. Create the plugin specifications for the agent to build
2. Instruct the agent to build the spec
3. Install the Figma plugin
4. Test & iterate

### Creating Plugin Specifications

Use the /enhance-spec-interview command to conduct a comprehensive interview with the user to gather detailed requirements, technical considerations, UX/UI preferences, and architectural decisions.

### Building Plugin From Spec

Use the /build-from-spec command to read the `SPEC.md` file and implement the complete plugin according to the specification. This command transforms the starter template into a fully functional plugin matching all requirements, features, and technical details documented in the specification.

### Cursor Commands

These are operational guides found in the `.cursor/commands` directory. Each markdown file describes step-by-step workflows for common tasks (e.g., setting up new features, creating READMEs). Use them as references for structured development and project onboarding.

### Cursor Rules

Rules and agent instructions (like those in `AGENTS.md`) document coding standards, architectural best practices, and automation guidelines for this repository. They help ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistent plugin development patterns.
