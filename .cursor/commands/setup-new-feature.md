# Setup New Feature

## Overview

Systematically set up a new feature from initial planning through to implementation structure.

## Steps

1. **Define requirements**

   - Clarify feature scope and goals
   - Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Plan technical approach
   - Create feature specification file named `SPEC-FEATURE-<TOPIC>.md` in the project root
     - Replace `<topic>` with a descriptive, kebab-case name for the feature (e.g., `SPEC-FEATURE-USER-AUTHENTICATION.md`, `SPEC-FEATURE-EXPORT-FUNCTIONALITY.md`)
     - Document all requirements, user stories, technical approach, and acceptance criteria in this file

2. **Create feature branch**

   - Branch from main/develop
   - Set up local development environment
   - Configure any new dependencies

3. **Plan architecture**
   - Design data models and APIs
   - Plan UI components and flow
   - Consider testing strategy
