## Logging

- When asked to log changes. Make sure to grab date and time first every time.
- Maintain a MEMORY.md file in the root project of each app or package depending where the changes occurred so that we can track all changes made through Composer.
- For example apps/api/MEMORY.md or apps/web/MEMORY.md
- Log format should be:

```markdown
## [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]

- Change description 1
- Additional details or context
- Change description 2
- File path affected
- Nature of change
```

- Each log entry should include:
- Date and time of changes in [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS] format
- To get the correct timestamp:
  1. Run `date "+%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"` in the terminal
  2. Use the exact output in the log header format: `## [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]`
- Bullet points for each change made
- Relevant file paths and descriptions
- Context or reasoning when necessary
- Group related changes under a single timestamp
- Keep logs organized chronologically
- Use clear, concise descriptions
- Include enough detail for future reference
- Separate different days with clear headers
- Use yarn as the package manager for installing dependencies.
